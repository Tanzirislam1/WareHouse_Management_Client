# WareHouse_Management

live link [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Our website has been made a warehouse related where many items will be stocked and sold from there.

Our Full Website Short Description:
* I put a banner on the home page. I have given 4 sections, one of which is called our Feature car, Our Services, with multiple pages Inventory, ManageInventory. Clicking on them will take you to different routes and different pages. I have also given the item that you must login to see if you do not have to login. These were the features of the home page.

* There is also a route called Manage Items where you can delete your items.

* There is also an inventory page where you can increase or decrease the quantity of your item if you want.

* After that you can add one of your items in the add item.

* My Item where you can see the items that you have added to your item.

* 404 error is given in the note found component. If the user wants to go on a wrong road, he will be given an error. No, it will just sit in ambush in one place
