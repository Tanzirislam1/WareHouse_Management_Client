Our website has been made a Warehouse related where many items will be stocked and sold from there.

Our Full Website Short Description:
* I put a banner on the home page. I have given 4 sections, one of which is called our Feature cars, Our Feature Services, with also multiple pages Inventory, ManageInventory, addInventory etc. Clicking on them will take you to different routes and different pages. I have also given the item that you must login to see if you do not have to login. These were the features of the home page.

* There is also a route called Manage Items where you can delete your items.

* There is also an inventory page where you can increase or decrease the quantity of your item if you want.

* After that you can add one of your items in the add item.

* My Item where you can see the items that you have added to your item.

* 404 error is given in the note found component. If the user wants to go on a wrong road, he will be given an error. No, it will just sit in ambush in one place
